- **Comprehensive Risk Assessment**: Evaluates multiple risk categories:
  - Fire & Life Safety
  - Structural & Construction
  - Security
  - Water Damage & Flood
  - Environmental & Location
- **Real-time Health Monitoring**: Built-in service health checks
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, professional interface with custom CSS styling

## üîß Risk Categories Analyzed

### Fire & Life Safety Risks

### Installation

1. **Navigate to the Python directory**
   ```bash
   cd python/
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Update the `.env` file with your Azure OpenAI configuration:
   ```env
   4.1_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com/
   4.1_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   4.1_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4-vision
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   The application will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`

- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for risk mitigation
- **Additional Info Needed**: Follow-up questions for more thorough assessment

## üîç Usage Instructions

1. **Upload Images**: 
   - Click the file upload area or drag and drop images
   - Support for JPG, PNG, WebP formats
   - Maximum 10 images per analysis

2. **Start Analysis**:
   - Click "Analyze Building Risks" button
   - Wait for AI processing (typically 30-60 seconds)

3. **Review Results**:
   - View overall risk level and score
   - Examine detailed category assessments
   - Read recommendations and findings

4. **Health Check**:
   - Use sidebar "Check Service Health" to verify connectivity
   - Troubleshoot connection issues if needed

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `4.1_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL
- `4.1_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your Azure OpenAI API key
- `4.1_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`: Name of your GPT-4 Vision deployment

### Customization Options
- **File Upload Limits**: Modify `max_files` parameter in `st.file_uploader()`
- **Styling**: Edit CSS in `st.markdown()` sections for custom appearance
- **Risk Categories**: Modify prompts in `azure_openai_service.py` to adjust analysis focus
- **Chart Types**: Change Plotly chart configurations for different visualizations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Service not available" error**:
   - Check your `.env` file configuration
   - Verify Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key
   - Ensure deployment name matches your Azure setup

2. **Image upload fails**:
   - Verify file format (JPG, PNG, WebP only)
   - Check file size (should be < 10MB per image)
   - Ensure you're not uploading more than 10 images

3. **Analysis takes too long**:
   - Large images may take longer to process
   - Multiple images increase processing time
   - Check Azure OpenAI service status

4. **JSON parsing errors**:
   - The service includes fallback handling for malformed responses
   - Check the "View Detailed AI Response" section for raw output

### Performance Tips
- **Image Optimization**: Resize large images before upload for faster processing
- **Batch Processing**: Upload related images together for comprehensive analysis
- **Network**: Ensure stable internet connection for Azure API calls
